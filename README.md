### Example Cardano NFT Marketplace

This repository is made for educational purposes, it includes a very simple swap script, and a frontend that demonstrates how to interact with the Yoroi extension wallet. It includes example methods to mint NFTs, display them, send them to the swap script and use the buy/cancel functionality of the swap script.

However, the app is made for demonstration purposes and has no backend and database, local storage is used as a temporary solution.
